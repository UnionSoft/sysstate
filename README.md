SysState
========

About
-----

System State - or SysState for short - is a tool to visualize the states of projects on various environments, resulting in an EcoSystem.

This EcoSystem allows IT to... 
- quickly gain insight in which version of what application is deployed where 
- if the projects are stable or not based on their internal diagnostics.
 
To improve visualization a number of templates are available:
- A spacious table based template
- A monitoring red/green table based template
- A drilldown template

These templates are represented using views. Views allow you to combine a template and a filter to narrow down the results.

Extendable
----------
SysState is extendable by placing additional plugins in the sysstate-server/plugins directory before packaging. A more versatile way to load plugins is still in progress.

An example module is provided to create your own plugins (sysstate-example).
